In this project, I developed an Ordinal Logistic Regression model to predict salary classes, incorporating advanced data preprocessing and modeling techniques. Initial data cleansing involved removing redundant features and employing various encoding strategies—Ordinal for inherently ordered data, Binary for dichotomous variables, and One-Hot for nominal data. Feature selection was rigorously performed using L1 Lasso regularization, effectively reducing dimensionality by driving less significant coefficients to zero, which was crucial for avoiding model overfitting. I implemented the model with a robust validation approach using 10-fold cross-validation, ensuring a thorough evaluation across different subsets of the data. Model tuning was executed via a grid search algorithm to optimize the regularization parameter 'C' and select the best regularization method between L1 and L2, guided by the model's performance on a weighted F1-score due to the prevalence of class imbalances. Python’s scikit-learn library facilitated the implementation of the machine learning pipeline, while NLTK supported the NLP preprocessing tasks. This approach emphasized a technical and analytical framework to enhance prediction accuracy and mode
