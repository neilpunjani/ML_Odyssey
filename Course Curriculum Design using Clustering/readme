I engineered a Master’s Degree curriculum in Business and Management, focusing on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, by leveraging advanced data scraping, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and feature engineering techniques. I utilized NLP to meticulously extract and encode skills from online job descriptions, employing tokenization, n-grams, and everygram analysis for nuanced skill identification. Concurrently, I conducted feature engineering to create meaningful attributes, such as skill frequency and transferability, which facilitated a more informed clustering process. Hierarchical and K-Means clustering algorithms were then applied to systematically structure these skills into a curriculum. Hierarchical clustering was used to discern initial skill groups based on co-occurrence, while K-Means provided refinements, ensuring the curriculum’s logical structure based on the interdependencies and relevance of skills. This comprehensive methodology enabled the integration of crucial technical and managerial competencies, crafting a curriculum that is closely aligned with industry demands and job market analytics
