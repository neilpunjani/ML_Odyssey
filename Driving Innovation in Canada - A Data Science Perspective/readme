In our study, we set out to elevate Canada's standing in the World Intellectual Property Organization's innovation rankings by focusing on specific actionable input indicators. We employed an ensemble of regression models to reverse engineer the WIPO indices and assess their relative influence on the innovation rankings. Our methodology included advanced data extraction using custom PDF-scraping tools, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest. Through this approach, we identified that Canada significantly lags in two main areas: R&D financed by business and national education spending compared to its OECD peers. The analysis highlighted these gaps and proposed a path forward that involves removing regulatory barriers, investing heavily in education, particularly in sustainability, and providing incentives for businesses to develop clean technologies. By implementing these recommendations, we aim to create a more business-friendly environment and elevate Canada’s innovation capabilities on a global scale. This well-rounded approach, backed by data-driven insights, suggests that increasing Canada’s performance across all key input indicators by 36% could potentially place it fifth globally. Our findings underline the importance of a holistic improvement strategy that focuses not only on increasing the numbers but also on creating a thriving ecosystem for innovation to flourish.
