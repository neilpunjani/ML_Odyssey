In these projects, we aimed to enhance prediction models using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) technique for both classification of wine quality and regression of housing prices, highlighting the common goal of optimizing predictive accuracy. Both studies emphasized data standardization and the implementation of validation strategiesâ€”specifically comparing the holdout method and cross-validation. For classification, accuracy served as the performance metric, with cross-validation showing superior consistency and reliability over holdout. In regression, we measured performance using mean squared error (MSE), where again, models validated through cross-validation exhibited significantly lower MSEs than those using the holdout method. This comparative analysis demonstrated that while both methods benefit from standardization, cross-validation generally offers more robust and generalizable models across different datasets and prediction tasks.
